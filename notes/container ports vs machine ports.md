# Container ports vs Machine ports 


![[../assets/imgs/Container_Ports_Host_Ports.png]]

***Always remember that when you run a container you need check its container port and vm port such that it doesn't clash with the same port on host*** 

To run a container on port the command is 

```bash
docker run --name ArchTest -dit -p 6000:6001 archlinux 
```

-  --name  --> Name of the container
-  -dit  --> run it in dettach mode and and with a interactive terminal 
-  -p  --> host_port : container_port
