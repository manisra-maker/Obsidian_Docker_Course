# Docker sample command to run arch linux container

```bash
docker run --name ArchTest -dit -p 6000:6001 archlinux 
```

-  --name  --> Name of the container
-  -dit  --> run it in dettach mode and and with a interactive terminal 
-  -p  --> host_port : container_port

# How to check specific container logs 

docker logs container_id

# Entering inside a container or accessing the shell

```bash
docker exec-it archlinux /bin/bash
```
