# Creating docker volumes 

If we have state-full applications  or where data must persist we use docker volumes

![](../assets/imgs/Docker%20Volumes.png)

Here we mount the host file system with the docker file system 

So when docker container write it will write to host as well

## Docker volumes are of 3 types 

### -v 

```bash
docker run -v /home/mount/data:/var/lib/mysql/data
``` 

First is host file system and second is container 

next is just giving one path that will handle via  creating a file system inside the container 

Another one is giving -v name:/var/lib/mysql/data


Same thing inside a docker compose file
